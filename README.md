    Download keymob library KeymobAd.framework,  add it to the library path of android project<br/>
    Download advertising platform libraries, keymob supports many platforms, but only need to add your own advertising platform library used to xcode project.<br/>
   The following are the library files of each advertising platform<br/>
   admob： GoogleMobileAds.framework<br/>
   amazon:  AmazonAd.framework,AmazonInsightsSDK.framework<br/>

####  b.Setup and initialize keymob
```
	adapter=[[AdManager alloc ]initWith:self andListener:[[AdEventListener alloc]init]];
	[adapter configWithJSON:textFileContents];
```
The first parameter  is context controller, it as necessary, and can not be null.<br/>
  The second parameter is the config info of each platform in json string format,json format reference template.<br/>
  The third parameter is event listener of advertising,witch is a class that implements interface IAdEventListener, if you do not want to deal with advertising events, you can set it to null.<br/>

#### c. Display banner advertising
```
	[adapter showRelationBanner:BANNER_SIZE_BANNER atPosition:BANNER_POSITIONS_BOTTOM_CENTER withOffY:80];
```
The above means that displays the standard banner ad at the bottom of the device . The first parameter is the ad size, the type size can be const named BANNER_SIZE_XXX, including the standard banner, rectange banner, smart banner and so on.<br/>
  Other banner size outside  standard size(320*50) may have  small differences in the different platforms, run to see the effects.<br/>
  The second parameter is the position of the banner displayed,  the value const of each position is  name BANNER_POSITIONS_XXX,including the top left, top center, top right-hand and so on ,9 kinds of common position total.<br/>
  The third parameter is offsetY, i.e., the relative positional deviation, e.g., on the bottom of the application, the upward offset 80 pixels, that is, the effect of the above code. If you want to stick to the bottom of the application, set the offsetY 0.<br/>
 
####  d. display banner at Fixed location

####  e. Hide banne ad
```	
	[adapter removeBanner];
```
   "removeBanner" hidden banner advertising, but advertising will not be destroyed so show can be quickly presented to the user next time. Some advertising platform will continue to  load ad after hidden , so the event will dispatched also.<br/>

### 3.Advertising platform configuration file template
```
	{
		"isTesting":true,//Whether it is in test mode
		"rateModel":1,//0 said rate is  represents the weight of each platform ,1 said the rate is the order of each platform to display ads
		"platforms":[
		{"adapter":"AdmobAdapter","rate":90,"key1":"ca-app-pub-xxx/xxx","key2":"ca-app-pub-xxx/xxx","types":[0,1]},//admob  ,key1 banner ID，key2 Interstitial id
		{"adapter":"AmazonAdapter","rate":20,"key1":"xxx","types":[0,1]},//amazon ,key1 appkey
		{"adapter":"ChartboostAdapter","rate":40,"key1":"xxx","key2":"xxx","types":[1,2,3]},//chartboost ,key1 appID，key2 signature
		{"adapter":"InmobiAdapter","rate":50,"key1":"xxx","types":[0,1]},//inmobi ,key1 appid 
		{"adapter":"IadAdapter","rate":50,"types":[0,1]},//iad ,will be automatically ignored on android
		{"adapter":"MMediaAdapter","rate":50,"key1":"xxx","key2":"xxx","types":[0,1]}//mmedia ,key1 banner apID，key2 Interstitial apid
		]
	}
```
Depending rate model rate will become the sort number or proportion.All keyName in config can not been modified."adapter" can not be modified and "types" can not be modified. "adapter", said platform implement, types indicates that the platform supports the type of ad.<br/>
Using the platform of you  choice, delete unused platform. You can also add your own platforms, then config in the list. Create your own advertising platform extensions tutorials will gradually improve later.<br/>
